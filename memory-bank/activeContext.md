## Current Work Focus
Customizing the Hugo Coder theme for the personal website, focusing on navigation layout adjustments.

## Recent Changes
- Restored the dark mode toggle to the header navigation bar, positioned on the right side.
- Deleted `layouts/partials/footer-toggle.html`.
- Updated `layouts/partials/header.html` to include the toggle with nav-right class.
- Removed partial inclusion from `layouts/_default/baseof.html`.
- Updated `assets/scss/custom.scss` to remove fixed styles and add right-alignment CSS.
- Adjusted CSS and HTML order in header to fix toggle appearing on left; now enforced on right via flexbox.

## Next Steps
- Verify the toggle is now on the right side using the running local server at http://localhost:62675/.
- If still not correct, provide feedback for further adjustments.
- Commit changes once confirmed.

## Active Decisions
- Kept the toggle in the navigation for consistency with theme design, using CSS to ensure right alignment.
