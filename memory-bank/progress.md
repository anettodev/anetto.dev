# Progress

## What Works
- Basic Hugo site with Coder theme setup.
- Custom SCSS styles applied, including glassmorphism effects.
- Dark mode toggle restored to navigation bar, positioned on the right.
- Resume timeline expanded with earlier professional experiences.
- Production deployment updated with generated CSS files, resolving 404 errors for coder-dark.css and coder-light.css.

## What's Left to Build
- Fill in more detailed content for new resume sections if needed.
- Add more custom shortcodes or features as needed.
- Optimize for mobile responsiveness if issues arise.

## Current Status
The site is functional with all recent fixes deployed to production. Dark mode toggle should now work without 404 errors.

## Known Issues
- None identified yet; monitor production for confirmation.
