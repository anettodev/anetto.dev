Hello! My name is Antonio. I am a proud father of twins, a computer scientist, and a software developer.

Originally hailing from Recife-PE, Brazil 🇧🇷, I currently reside in Belo Horizonte-MG, Brazil 🇧🇷. 

As a Brazilian, **Portuguese** (pt-br) is my mother tongue, however, I am also proficient in **English** (en-us), and I possess a good command of Latin American and Caribbean **Spanish** (es-419).

### 🧑‍💻 Profile 

With over 15 years of experience in software development, I started my career in 2007, primarily concentrating on web development, handling tasks on both the back-end and front-end using PHP and JS.

Nonetheless, from 2011 onward, my professional trajectory pivoted toward  iOS mobile development (beginning with iOS 4.3). I am proficient in both Objective-C and Swift programming languages.

Since 2015, I have held a bachelor's degree in __computer science__ from the _[Catholic University of Pernambuco][unicap]_.

Throughout my career, I have served diverse industries (both B2B  B2C), including e-commerce, the automobile sector, logistics, communications, education, IT consulting, and banking/finance with some of them listed in [NASDAQ][nasdaq], [B3][b3], and the [Global Fortune 500][fortune500].

### 💻 Tech Skills 

For over a decade, I have been committed to working in mobile app development, with a focus on the  iOS platform.

My main programming languages nowadays are **Swift(UIKit & SwiftUI), Objective-C, C/C++, and Python**. 
However, I have also experimented with **C#, Java, PHP, JS** and many others.

This website for example, uses **GO** as it's main programming language.
